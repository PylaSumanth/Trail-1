<p>Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao was born in a Telugu Hindu agrarian family on 28 May 1923 in Nimmakuru, a small village in Gudivada taluk 
of Krishna district, which was a part of the erstwhile Madras Presidency of British India. He was given in adoption to his paternal uncle 
because his uncle and aunt were childless. He was first educated by a teacher who came from a nearby village, whom he would attribute 
his command of Telugu to, as well as his father, an aspiring thespian and patron of the arts. Although children were normally pulled 
out of school after completing their primary education, on account of being the first male child in the family, his father sent him to 
Vijayawada, where he continued his education, matriculating in 1940 before studying at SRR & CVR College and completed a bachelor’s degree 
from Andhra Christian College in Guntur. After qualifying for the civil service in what was then the Madras Presidency under British
 India, he took a job as a sub-registrar in Madras Service Commission at Mangalagiri, northeast of Guntur, a much-coveted job that he never
theless quit within three weeks to pursue a career in acting. He developed a baritone singing voice as a young man.</p>
